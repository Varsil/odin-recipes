    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked Churro Bites - "Just As Good, If Not Better?"</p>
    <p>No, they don't have the same crispy, crusty exterior the fried version features, but what they do
        have is pretty much everything else.</p>
    <p>The interior texture, adn flavor are virtually identical; and if use a star tip to pipe them, so
         is the appearance. Plus, they're both perfect dipped into thick, rich, Spanish-style hot chocolate,
         which may be the most important similarity.
